Welcome To my Project.

[*about me:*]{.underline}

I am a Data Science and Information Science Major and Business Minor student in the James Scholar Honors Program at UIUC. I am a data science researcher at Illini Blockchain, a member of the UIUC tennis club, Co-Founder of SCROLL and Bioinformatics researcher at IGB. I am taking IS 308 which is a course about the intersection of race, gender and Information Technology. Throughout the Course I found it interesting to see how certain ethnic backgrounds face different stigmas or issues especially in Video Games.
